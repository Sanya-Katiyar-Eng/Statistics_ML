# 📊 Measure of Central Tendency – Python

This repository contains Python programs to understand and implement **Measures of Central Tendency** — **Mean, Median, and Mode** — using different approaches such as **formulas, libraries, and real datasets**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

Implemented using:
- Mathematical formulas (manual logic)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Statistics module
- Seaborn (visualization)
- Iris dataset

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulas

### 🔹 Mean
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x}{n}
\]

### 🔹 Median
- Odd number of values → middle value  
- Even number of values → average of two middle values

### 🔹 Mode
- Value that occurs most frequently
